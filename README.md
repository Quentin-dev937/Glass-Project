# Glass Project

The goal of this project is to perform the classification of glass materials based on their chemical composition.
This dataset was download from the Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/glass

## Dataframe

This dataset is quite small. As we can observe, only 214 obervations are at our disposal. 
There is 9 predictive variables (features) and 1 target variable. 
#### Predictive variables
- RI: Refraction index of the glass.
- Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe: weight percent in corresponding oxide.

#### Target variable
- Type: the type of glass which can be one of 6 categories.
